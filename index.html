            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3> CATS ARE QUIET</h3>
                    If noise levels are a concern in your living situation, cats are a great choice of pet. Even the quietest bark will likely be much louder than the most insistent meowing. Depending on the cat, you may need to worry about other sounds such as them knocking
                    things off of surfaces or running around at top speed, but they are still likely to be more quiet overall. </li>
                <li>
                    <h3> CATS ARE LOW MAINTENANCE</h3>
                    Compared to dogs, cats are a low maintenance pet. They don’t require formal training, they don’t need to be taken out multiple times a day, and they’re even able to take care of basic self-cleaning. Of course, long-haired cats will still require regular
                    grooming, but it will likely involve less regular grooming than long-haired dogs.</li>
                <li>
                    <h3> CATS ARE EASY TO HOUSE-TRAIN</h3>
                    One of the biggest challenges dog owners need to overcome is the process of house-training a new puppy. Kittens, on the other hand, usually know how to use the litter box as soon as you bring them home. All you need to do is show them where it is, and
                    they’ll instinctively use it. </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3> CATS ARE INDEPENDENT</h3>
                    One of the best things about cats is that they are very independent creatures. Unlike dogs, who require quite a high level of attention each day, cats are quite happy to have time to themselves. In fact, cats will sleep for about 15 hours a day so you
                    don’t have to worry about them being too bored when you’re at work.</li>
                <li>
                    <h3>CATS HAVE A LONG LIFESPAN</h3>
                    Any pet owner knows that losing a pet is a truly heartbreaking experience. Fortunately, when it comes to house pets, cats have quite a long life expectancy. The average life span of a cat is 12 years, but it’s not uncommon for them to live into their
                    high teens or even early twenties.</li>
                <li>
                    <h3>CATS ARE GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH</h3>
                    Studies have shown that cats have a calming effect on their owners, from the soothing action of petting to purring being an aid in falling asleep. Cats can even play a part in lowering your blood pressure and risk of a heart attack. One 10-year study
                    has even shown that cat owners were 30% less likely to die of a heart attack or stroke than non-cat owners.</li>
